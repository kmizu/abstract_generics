## AbstractGenerics

AbstractGenerics is a library to provide generics emulation layer
on top of abstract types.  This provides:

* invariant generics emulation
* (co/contra)variant generics emulation
* function type emulation
* higher order function emulation (planned)
* type classes based on abstract type members
* , etc.

This is still an experimental library.
